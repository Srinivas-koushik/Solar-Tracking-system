# Solar-Tracking-system
Solar tracking system using arduino uno iot based project
Our project introduces an innovative solution to enhance solar energy harvesting efficiency through the implementation of an Internet of Things (IoT)-based solar tracking system. Traditional fixed solar panels often operate below their potential due to static positioning, limiting their exposure to sunlight. In contrast, our dynamic system continuously monitors 
and adjusts panel orientation in real-time using IoT technology. By tracking the sun's position and optimizing panel angles accordingly, our system maximizes solar radiation absorption, leading to significant improvements in energy harvesting efficiency compared to static installations. Additionally, remote monitoring and control capabilities enable users to manage the system conveniently, ensuring adaptability to various environmental conditions 
and user preferences
